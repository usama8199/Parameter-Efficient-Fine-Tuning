    "**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)** are techniques used to adapt large pre-trained models, such as those in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, with the aim of improving their performance on specific tasks while minimizing the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning. These methods are particularly valuable for efficiently customizing large models without the computational and memory overhead typically associated with training or fine-tuning such models.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\n",
    "LoRA focuses on adapting the weights of the pre-trained model in a low-rank subspace. Instead of updating all parameters of the model, LoRA identifies and updates a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing the computational cost and memory usage during fine-tuning. This approach is based on the observation that the effect of adapting a model can often be captured by adjusting only a small number of parameters.\n",
    "The key idea behind LoRA is to decompose certain weight matrices in the model into low-rank matrices. For example, consider a weight matrix W in a transformer model. LoRA would approximate adjustments to W using two smaller matrices A and B (where AB.T is the low-rank approximation), rather than directly modifying W. During fine-tuning, only A and B are learned, while W remains fixed. This low-rank approximation significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)\n",
    "Building on the principles of LoRA, QLoRA introduces quantization into the low-rank adaptation process to further reduce the computational and memory requirements. Quantization is a technique that reduces the precision of the model's parameters, effectively allowing the model to operate with lower-precision arithmetic. This can lead to further efficiency improvements, particularly in deployment scenarios where computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "QLoRA applies quantization to the matrices A and B in the low-rank approximation. By reducing the precision of these matrices, QLoRA decreases the amount of memory required to store them and the computational cost of using them during inference. This makes QLoRA an attractive option for deploying fine-tuned models to resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices or embedded systems."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for the task of text summarization using Qlora. You can find the detail paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14314.pdf). A little detail about qlora form paper is it backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) Double Quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. It is an updated version of [LoRA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf)."

It's not possible to check in for a flight after check in closes, as the system doesn't allow it. Late arrivals can cause flight delays and we apply the same policy to everyone, not just when it's 1/2 busy. I can understand your disappointment, but it's your responsibility to arrive at the airport in good time and complete check in before it closes.

You need to fix this with buses or something ASAP. It left a very bad taste in my mouth after a long trip.\\nagent: We understand that waiting in line after a long flight is not ideal, Maia. But the \\'trains’ between the Main Terminal and Gates 1-59 are currently being installed to replace the old ones.\\nuser: I understand WHY they are being replaced and I understand it is the responsibility of the airport, but it is more than just not ideal. Traveling during the holidays is stressful enough. Being ok with cutting capacity in half is very disappointing. Is anything being done at all to ameliorate the issue? Or is it just a “too bad, so sad, not our problem” situation?\\nagent: ...that can be put into place in coordination with everyone involved at the airport to help things run smoother. Unfortunately, longer lines are part of the process until the improved product is finished. 2/2 Airport renovations are something we look closely at as we understand it will affect how our customers are able to get to and from their flights. We don\\'t look to reduce flights as we know that takes travel options away, but we do look at available options and workarounds... 1/2\\nuser: And what is the workaround that has been put into place for this contingency? All that is communicated to passengers is \"we only have one shuttle running.\" An earlier message also indicated busses might be used. That is all that is obvious to passengers. One might also question the wisdom of making these improvements during the holidays unless absolutely necessary. Also something not communicated to passengers.\\nagent: We understand this experience at the airport was not ideal. We appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback with us.\\n\\n### Response: [/INST] \\nCustomer is complaining about the inconvenience of the transportation.

I'm showing First Class is sold out for your flights; however, Delta Comfort + is available. The Delta Comfort + cabin is sold as a fare for this market; therefore, in order to confirm Comfort + there will be a difference in the fare. *HML\\nuser: What does this upgrade list mean? And this one for the first leg of the flight?\\nagent: It looks like there may an error between our system and the app. I'm checking into this now. *HML\\nuser: ive heard about airlines blocking out seats for the purpose of overbooking and juggling to squeeze profits.

What's does that mean and how do I upgrade seats. That's the whole reason I tweeted you. Cmon Delta aka *HML\\nagent: Freddie, in order upgrade your ticket to First Class, you must pay the difference in the fare. In reviewing your ticket, you have no value left to apply towards the cost of the ticket to upgrade. *HML If you're using miles to upgrade, the cost is 35,000 miles each way and you must be booked in a L, U, or T class fare. *HML\\nuser: What do mean I must pay the difference but then say I have no value left in my ticket? Why not just tell me how much it is to upgrade like I've been asking from the beginning? What does it mean I have no value in a tix I purchased?\\nagent: To make changes to your reservation there is a change fee of $200.00. Your ticket is less than the change fee; therefore, there is no value in your ticket. I can provide an estimated cost to change your ticket; however, this does not include taxes and fees. *HML The estimated cost is $1,500.00 for First Class on your flight from EWR to GCM. This does not include taxes and airport fees and fares are not guaranteed until purchased. Please contact our International Reservation specialist at 1-800-241-4141. *HML\\n\\n### Response: [/INST] \\nCustomer is complaining about the inconvenience of unavailable first class seats and asking is there no value of purchased tix.

Your driver decoupled and recoupled it and the doors \"magically worked\". Serious breach in protocol there guys. Playing with safety because previous driver wanted to clock out.\\nagent: On occasion the electrical contacts that the trains use to pass communications for door controls, power and brake, information systems, etc will not make contact properly. In these cases, detaching and reattaching is the approved process taken in line with our fleet 1/3 team\\'s fault-finding instructions, and done under the instruction of maintenance staff and the fleet control manager. The train\\'s fail-safe systems would not allow it to move in this situation, and if we could not resolve the problem, the train would be taken out of service. 2/3 Safety is, and always will be, our first priority, and in this case protocols were followed correctly. Our fleet team will investigate using on-board monitoring systems as to what when wrong in this case and take appropriate action.  3/3\\nuser: So wait a second. Once a driver couples the train it\\'s not protocol to test immediately, but to wait until the carriages are full of passengers to then couple? That\\'s your statement?\\nagent: On more modern stock the train will undertake the necessary tests to confirm. With older trains, there is a \"pull-away\" test to confirm the trains are physically coupled together, but it is not always immediately apparent that the all of the 100+ contacts on the train 1/3 type in question are making suitable contact. Any one of these pins not making proper contact can result in the train not being able to move as part of fail-safe systems built in. As mentioned, more modern trains such as our 450 and 444 types have computer systems on board 2/3 which test each signal passing through the contacts to confirm that the train is attached both physically and electronically.  3/3\\nuser: Whilst I\\'m still shocked, I appreciate the fullness of the answer! :)\\nagent: No worries - I\\'m ex train-crew, so this is rather my specialist topic! Appreciate that it seems a little antiquated, but it\\'s all vetted and okayed by the safety bodies. It\\'s similar to the modern trains, where resolving problems can often come down to turning off the 1/2 train\\'s management systems and turning them back on again!  2/2\\nuser: Ahh that makes sense, thought the response was a little more detailed than usual. As a regular passenger I like understanding more, helps me to work around problems and know when to make alternative plans.
