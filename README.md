# Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques for Large Language Models
## Introduction
In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), large pre-trained models like GPT, BERT, and their derivatives have set new benchmarks for a myriad of tasks. However, the fine-tuning process for these models often involves substantial computational resources and memory, limiting their accessibility and adaptability. This repository introduces and explores Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), and prompt tuning, aimed at mitigating these challenges.


# Project Overview
The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate the efficacy of LoRA, QLoRA, and prompt tuning techniques in adapting large language models like Llama-2-7B for specific tasks with minimal computational overhead. Through detailed Jupyter notebooks, Prototype (private, company owned) and a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation, we delve into:

**Theoretical Background:** Understanding LoRA, QLoRA, and prompt tuning mechanics.\
**Practical Implementation:** Step-by-step guides on applying these techniques for fine-tuning.\
**Comparative Analysis:** Evaluating the performance and efficiency of PEFT techniques against traditional fine-tuning approaches.

## Results and Discussion
Our findings suggest that LoRA and QLoRA significantly reduce the computational and memory footprint of fine-tuning large language models, without compromising on model performance. Prompt tuning further enables task-specific model adaptation with minimal parameter updates. Key results and visualizations can be found within each notebook and the accompanying presentation.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the potential of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques as viable alternatives to traditional model fine-tuning approaches, especially in resource-constrained environments. By leveraging LoRA, QLoRA, and prompt tuning, we demonstrate that it is possible to maintain or even enhance model performance on specific tasks while substantially reducing the required computational resources.
